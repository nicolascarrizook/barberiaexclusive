# Schedule Configuration UI Redesign

## Overview
This document describes the redesign of the scheduling system to properly separate barbershop-level and barber-level configurations.

## Problem Statement
The current implementation incorrectly includes break times at the barbershop level. According to business logic:
- **Barbershop level**: Should only define opening/closing hours and capacity
- **Barber level**: Should define individual work schedules and break times

## Changes Implemented

### Phase 1: Updated BarbershopScheduleConfig Component ✅
- Removed break time fields from the form schema
- Removed break time UI elements (inputs for break_start and break_end)
- Updated the card title and description for clarity
- Added an informative alert explaining the configuration hierarchy
- Simplified the UI to show only essential barbershop settings

### Phase 2: Created BarberWorkingHours Component ✅
- New component for managing individual barber work schedules
- Includes both work hours and daily break times
- Validates barber hours against barbershop hours
- Option to copy barbershop hours as a starting point
- Clear visual indicators for barbershop constraints

### Phase 3: Enhanced BarberScheduleManager Component ✅
- Added tabs to separate "Work Schedule" from "Temporary Breaks"
- Integrated the new BarberWorkingHours component
- Clear distinction between regular schedule and ad-hoc breaks
- Informative alerts to guide users

### Phase 4: Added Owner Management Interface ✅
- Created BarberScheduleDialog for owners to manage barber schedules
- Added schedule management button to barber cards in the owner view
- Allows owners to configure schedules for all their barbers

## Database Migration (Pending)

A migration file has been created at `database/migrations/007_barber_working_hours.sql` but should NOT be applied yet. The migration will:

1. Create `barber_working_hours` table for individual schedules
2. Migrate existing data from barbershop-level breaks
3. Mark barbershop break columns as deprecated
4. Add validation triggers and RLS policies

## Next Steps

1. **Testing Phase**
   - Test the UI changes thoroughly
   - Ensure validation works correctly
   - Verify the user experience is intuitive

2. **Service Layer Update**
   - Implement service methods for barber working hours
   - Update availability calculations to use individual schedules
   - Ensure backward compatibility during transition

3. **Database Migration**
   - Apply the migration after UI is stable
   - Update the service layer to use new tables
   - Remove deprecated UI code that references old break fields

4. **Documentation Update**
   - Update user documentation
   - Create training materials for the new workflow
   - Update API documentation if applicable

## UI/UX Improvements

### Barbershop Configuration (Owner View)
- Clean, focused interface for business hours only
- Clear messaging about configuration scope
- Visual capacity indicators

### Barber Schedule Management
- **Work Schedule Tab**: Regular weekly schedule with breaks
- **Temporary Breaks Tab**: Ad-hoc breaks and exceptions
- Visual validation against barbershop hours
- Intuitive copy functionality from barbershop defaults

### Benefits
- Clear separation of concerns
- More flexibility for individual barbers
- Better scalability for multi-location businesses
- Improved user experience with focused interfaces
